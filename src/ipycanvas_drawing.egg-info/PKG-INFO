# Drawing utility in ipycanvas
Small utility to make simple drawings in Jupyter notebooks with ipycanvas and ipywidgets.

## Installing
```pip install ipycanvas-drawing```

## Usage
Create a simple drawing interface:

```python
from ipycanvas-drawing import DrawingWidget

drawing_widget = DrawingWidget(width=500, height=500)
drawing_widget.show()

# Get output as numpy array
image_data = drawing_widget.canvas.get_image_data()
```

## Credits
Based on the [hand drawing example](https://github.com/martinRenou/ipycanvas/blob/master/examples/hand_drawing.ipynb) provided by @martinRenou, but adds some additional functionality like adding squares and ellipses and a 1-step undo.
