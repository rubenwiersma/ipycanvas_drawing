# Drawing utility in ipycanvas
Small utility to make simple drawings in Jupyter notebooks with ipycanvas and ipywidgets.

Based on the [hand drawing example](https://github.com/martinRenou/ipycanvas/blob/master/examples/hand_drawing.ipynb) provided by @martinRenou, but adds some additional functionality like adding squares and ellipses and a 1-step undo.
